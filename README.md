# TC McCarthy's dev scripts

This is a repository of scripts I use to set up dev computers and servers quickly

* dev_setup.sh -- OSX dev computer setup script (Homebrew, Compass, node, awscli, pip, zsh, etc.)
* svnalises.md -- svn reconciliation aliases (Makes it easier to bulk delete/add/commit modifications, zsh and filesystem changes)
* ubuntuKickStart.sh -- Ubuntu server setup script (Sets up nginx, mysql, php, aws, etc)
* TC.terminal -- Classy-ass shell theme that goes nicely with zsh
* Gruntfile.js -- Sample Gruntfile that uses my most frequently used procedures
* Grunt shell -- Sample file structure for grunt-powered projects
